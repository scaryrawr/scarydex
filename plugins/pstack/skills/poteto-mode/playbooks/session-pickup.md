### Session pickup

**You own the resume point. Read the prior trail, don't redo it.**

1. Locate the prior trail. Read the supplied local handoff. When the user requests chat history, use the supplied Codex session ID or URL, the app’s scoped chat-reading tools scoped to that session, app session tools, or the pushed branch. Read metadata and the latest turns first, then scan back for decision points. Reduce a long history in a subagent and keep only the timeline in the main thread (the **principle-guard-the-context-window** skill).
2. Reconstruct operational state. Confirm the branch and worktree, what already landed (`git log`, `git diff` against the base), the open todos, and the decisions made. The handoff and prior trail are authoritative inputs, while the current repository is authoritative for what still exists.
3. Diff done vs pending. Compare what shipped against what was planned, name the resume point, do not re-run the prior repro or redo completed work. A "let me verify from scratch" pass means you're treating the trail as untrustworthy when it's authoritative.
4. Route the remaining work to the matching playbook and pick the verdict: continue the execution, ship a finished recommendation, ratify or override a prior conclusion, or postmortem a failed run. The pickup playbook ends here. The routed playbook owns the rest.
5. Verify the inherited claims against the original goal on the real artifact (the **principle-prove-it-works** skill). A passing prior self-report is not the proof.

**Reply:** where the prior agent stopped, what you inherited vs redid (ideally nothing redone), the resume point, and the outcome.
